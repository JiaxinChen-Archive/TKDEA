## Introduction

Bilevel optimization is a special type of optimization in which one problem is embedded within another. The bilevel optimization problem of which both levels are multi-objective functions is usually called the multi-objective bilevel optimization problem (MBLOP). The expensive computation and nested features make it challenging to solve. 

We propose a multi-objective bilevel optimization solving routine combined with a knee point driven algorithm. Specifically, the proposed algorithm aims to quickly find feasible solutions considering the lower-level constraints in the first stage and then concentrates the computational resources on finding solutions with better performance. 

Besides, we develop several multi-objective bilevel test problems with different properties, such as scalable, deceptive, convexity, and (dis)continuous.  

Finally, the performance of the algorithm is validated on a practical petroleum refining bilevel problem, which involves a multi-objective environmental regulation problem and a petroleum refining operational problem. Comprehensive experiments fully demonstrate the effectiveness of our presented algorithm in solving MBLOPs.
